# Derivative AI

What passes for as generative AI is just derivative AI. They are able to create derivatives from existing content but they do not as yet create any original content.

Do humans actually create anything orignal? Do we not create derivatives of the reality around us? I would say yes to that to a great extent but creativity must be understood further to see the distinction between human creativity and the derivative creativity of AI.
