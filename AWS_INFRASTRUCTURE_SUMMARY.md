# Implementation of AWS Infrastructure for Musings

We've successfully implemented item 8 from the TODO list, which involves creating AWS infrastructure using AWS CDK for the Musings static blog publisher. Here's what we've accomplished:

## Completed Tasks

### 8.1 Implement AWS CDK configurations for AWS S3 hosting
- Created a CDK stack that provisions an S3 bucket for static website hosting
- Configured the bucket with proper permissions and website hosting settings
- Added outputs for easy access to the bucket information

### 8.2 Add CloudFront CDN integration
- Implemented CloudFront distribution for CDN capabilities
- Configured the distribution to serve content from the S3 bucket
- Added compression and proper security settings

### 8.5 Implement deployment pipelines
- Created a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline
- Integrated with GitHub for source control
- Added build and deployment stages
- Included CloudFront invalidation for immediate content updates

### 8.6 Add monitoring and logging
- Implemented CloudWatch alarms for key metrics:
  - High 4XX error rates
  - High latency
  - Low bytes downloaded
  - S3 bucket size monitoring
- Created SNS topic for alarm notifications

## Partially Implemented Tasks

### 8.3 Implement Route53 DNS configuration
- Added code structure for Route53 integration
- Implemented hosted zone lookup
- Created A record for custom domain (requires domain configuration)

### 8.4 Add SSL certificate management
- Added code structure for ACM certificate management
- Implemented DNS-validated certificate creation
- Integrated with CloudFront distribution (requires domain configuration)

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows AWS best practices for static website hosting:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Using AWS CDK for reproducible infrastructure
2. **Security**: HTTPS by default with ACM certificates
3. **Performance**: CloudFront CDN for global content delivery
4. **Reliability**: S3 durability for static assets
5. **Automation**: CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
6. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms for operational visibility

## Usage

To deploy the infrastructure:

1. Navigate to the `infrastructure/aws-cdk` directory
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Configure AWS credentials with `aws configure`
4. Deploy with `cdk deploy` (optionally with context parameters for custom domains)

## Next Steps

To fully complete items 8.3 and 8.4, you would need to:

1. Configure a custom domain in Route53
2. Update the CDK context with domain information
3. Deploy the stack with the custom domain parameters

This implementation provides a solid foundation for hosting the Musings static blog on AWS with automated deployments and monitoring.
